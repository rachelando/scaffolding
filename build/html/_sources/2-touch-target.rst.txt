Touch target size
::::::::::::::::::::::::

What is target size?
Target size refers to how large or small buttons or other clickable/touchable targets are on a website.

The following is from WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.5.5: Target Size (Level AAA).
The WCAG can be difficult to understand due to technical language.
We will work through it to understand what it means and how to apply it.
Please read the following WCAG excerpt and then answer the following questions.

.. note::

    The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels except when:

    :Equivalent:
        The target is available through an equivalent link or control on the same page that is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels;
    :Inline:
        The target is in a sentence or block of text;
    :User Agent Control:
        The size of the target is determined by the user agent and is not modified by the author;
    :Essential:
        A particular presentation of the target is essential to the information being conveyed.

Why does target size matter?
Here is another excerpt from WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.5.5: Target Size (Level AAA).
Please read it then answer the following questions.

.. note::

    The intent of this success criteria is to ensure that target sizes are large enough for users to easily activate them, even if the user is accessing content on a small handheld touch screen device, has limited dexterity, or has trouble activating small targets for other reasons.
    For instance, mice and similar pointing devices can be hard to use for these users, and a larger target will help them activate the target.

    Touch is particularly problematic as it is an input mechanism with coarse precision.
    Users lack the same level of fine control when using inputs such as a mouse or stylus.
    A finger is larger than a mouse pointer, and generally obstructs the user's view of the precise location on the screen that is being touched/activated.

    The issue can even be further complicated with responsive layouts on small screens like mobile, which need to accommodate different types of fine and coarse inputs.
    Both input types must be supported for a site that can be accessed both on a traditional desktop/laptop with a mouse, as well as on a tablet or mobile phone with a touch screen.
