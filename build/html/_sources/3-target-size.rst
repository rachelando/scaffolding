::::::::::::::::::::::::

--------------------
What is target size?
--------------------

Target size refers to **how large or small buttons or other clickable/touchable targets are** on a website.

Target size in the WCAG ✅
--------------------------

The following is from WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.5.5: Target Size (Level AAA).
The WCAG can be difficult to understand but we will work through it to understand it and how to apply it.
Please read the following WCAG excerpt and then answer the following questions.

    The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels except when:

    :Equivalent: The target is available through an equivalent link or control on the same page that is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels;
    :Inline: The target is in a sentence or block of text;
    :User Agent Control: The size of the target is determined by the user agent and is not modified by the author;
    :Essential: A particular presentation of the target is essential to the information being conveyed.

Why does target size matter? ✅
-------------------------------

Here is another excerpt from WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.5.5: Target Size (Level AAA).
Please read it then answer the following questions.

    The intent of this success criteria is to ensure that target sizes are large enough for users to easily activate them, even if the user is accessing content on a small handheld touch screen device, has limited dexterity, or has trouble activating small targets for other reasons.
    For instance, mice and similar pointing devices can be hard to use for these users, and a larger target will help them activate the target.

.. raw:: html


          <div class="mcq">
                <p>From this excerpt, why is it important to have large enough target sizes?</p>
		<form name=Q3 id="Q3" data-component="target-size">
		<input type="checkbox" id="Q3A1" value=""><label for="Q3A1">Some devices have small screens</label> <span id="Q3A1-feedback"> </span><br> 		<input type="checkbox" id="Q3A2" value=""><label for="Q3A2">Some users have limited dexterity</label> <span id="Q3A2-feedback"> </span><br> 		<input type="checkbox" id="Q3A3" value=""><label for="Q3A3">Larger targets help users who find mice hard to use</label> <span id="Q3A3-feedback"> </span><br> 		<input type="checkbox" id="Q3A4" value="correct"><label for="Q3A4">All of the above</label> <span id="Q3A4-feedback"> </span><br> 
                <input type="button" value="Check" onclick="sendmcq('Q3')"><br>
		</form>

		[ 	{ "ansid":"Q3A1", "answer": "Some devices have small screens", "feedback": "That's true but there is a more correct answer.", "result": ""  } ,	{ "ansid":"Q3A2", "answer": "Some users have limited dexterity", "feedback": "That's true but there is a more correct answer.", "result": ""  } ,	{ "ansid":"Q3A3", "answer": "Larger targets help users who find mice hard to use", "feedback": "That's true but there is a more correct answer.", "result": ""  } ,	{ "ansid":"Q3A4", "answer": "All of the above", "feedback": "That's right!", "result": "correct"  }

Different target size standards
-------------------------------

As well as the WCAG, there are other important standards for touch target size.
Apple and Android both have guidelines for developers as well as the Nielsen group who provide guidance on user experience.
However these standards are all slightly different and in different units which makes it difficult to check if all of them are fulfilled.

:Apple: 44 x 44 pt
:Android: 48 x 48 dp
:Nielsen: 1 x 1 cm
:WCAG: 44 x 44 CSS pixels

Adee simplifies these by converting the standards to the same unit, px.
Adee also helps designers check whether the standards are fulfilled all at one glance.
This makes it far easier and quicker for designers to check all of these guidelines at once.

Device size
-----------

Minimum touch target size **depends on the device** displaying the interface.
Adee automatically calculates the minimum touch size depending on which device you select.
It is important to check that a design fulfils the required standards for a range of devices.

.. admonition:: Adee task 1

     Check the target size of a button against accessibility standards.

     1. Select the button under Task 1
     2. Open the Adee plugin to "Touch Size Checker tool"
     3. Test the size of the button if an iPhone Mini device was used
     4. Based on the results, explain how a designer should improve the button size for better accessibility
     5. Close the plugin
