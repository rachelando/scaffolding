How is my progress tracked?
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

As you work through EarlyAccess, you can track your progress on the side navigation menu.
There are two methods for this:

- Confidence self-ratings (from 1-5)

- Question performance tracking

Your confidence self-ratings will be represented as face emojis next to each main heading on the navigation side panel on the *left*.

    Confidence self-ratings:

    :1Ô∏è‚É£: Never heard of it
    :2Ô∏è‚É£: Know very little
    :3Ô∏è‚É£: Know a fair amount

EarlyAccess contains 17 multiple-choice questions as well as 8 multiple-choice questions in a final quiz.
Your progress will be shown as an emoji on the left on the main headings.
