Welcome to EarlyAccess!

--------------------
What is EarlyAccess?
--------------------

EarlyAccess is a tool designed to help people learn about and implement web accessibility.
It does not cover accessibility comprehensively.
Rather, it is specifically designed to help people use the accessible design tool Adee effectively.
EarlyAccess does so by providing brief general education and motivations for accessibility and then guides users' learning of each of Adee's 4 functionalities:

- Target size,

- Alt text,

- Colour blindness, and

- Colour contrast.

From its name, EarlyAccess specially aims to encourage and equip people to incorporate accessibility early in the web design process.

How is my progress tracked?
---------------------------

As you work through EarlyAccess, your progress will be tracked.
There are two methods for this:

- Confidence self-ratings (from 1-5)

- Short question performance tracking

Your confidence self-ratings will be represented as face emojis next to each main heading on the navigation side panel on the *left*.

    Confidence self-ratings:

    :😰: 1 - Never heard of it
    :😕: 2 - Know very little
    :😐: 3 - Know a fair amount
    :😊: 4 - Know/understand quite well
    :🥳: 5 - Could explain it to a friend

Your short question progress and performance will also be represented as an emoji on the left on the main headings.
Short answer progress will also be shown for subheadings within a page on the navigation panel on the *right*.

    Short question performance:

    :❓: Not started
    :❌: Incorrect
    :✴️: Partial marks
    :✅: Full marks
