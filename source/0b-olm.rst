Showing your progress
:::::::::::::::::::::

As you work through EarlyAccess, you can track your progress on the side navigation menu.
There are two methods for this:

- Multiple-choice question progress

- Confidence self-ratings (from 1-5)

See the menu on the *left* for a key for both of these.

.. Note:: Since you have not started any questions or self-ratings, ‚ùì is displayed for both for all modules.
