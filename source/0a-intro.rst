Introduction

Welcome to EarlyAccess, a collection of interactive educational modules about web accessibility.

--------------------
What is EarlyAccess?
--------------------

EarlyAccess is a tool designed to help people learn about and implement web accessibility.
It does not cover accessibility comprehensively.
EarlyAccess is specifically designed to help you effectively use the accessible design tool **Adee**.
From its name, EarlyAccess specially aims to encourage and equip people to incorporate accessibility early in the web design process.

You are able to see each of the **modules** you will work through on the menu on the left.
The first 4 modules are introductory and explain how EarlyAccess works.
The following 3 modules teach about accessibility generally and motivations for accessibility.
The following 5 modules teach about **Adee's 4 functionalities**:

- Target size,

- Alt text,

- Colour blindness, and

- Colour contrast.

Each module has information to read, interactive multiple-choice questions, and a final self-knowledge rating.
The modules about Adee's 4 functionalities also contain tasks to complete with Adee in a web design software called Figma.
You will start using Adee and Figma in the next introductory module.
