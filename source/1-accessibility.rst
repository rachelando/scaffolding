.. Tip:: Did you notice the question progress symbol change on the left menu after you pressed check?

It can be easy to think that not many people have disabilities and therefore accessibility is not a large concern.
However, **1.3 billion people** globally experience a significant disability [#]_.

-------------------------------
Why is accessibility important?
-------------------------------

Accessibility helps **everyone**, not just people with disabilities.
For example, poor vision may be simply caused by direct sunlight to a laptop rather than a disability.

Accessibility can also benefit **other groups of users** other than just those with disabilities such as elderly people.
Another example is users who prefer to navigate websites with the keyboard rather than a mouse for efficiency.
People with low dexterity due to disability also cannot use a mouse.

Accessibility also helps **businesses** generate more profit in the long term.
It helps generate more customers through accommodating more user groups.
Accessibility also drives innovation and minimises legal risks. Therefore, accessibility is worth pursuing from **both ethical and practical viewpoints**.
