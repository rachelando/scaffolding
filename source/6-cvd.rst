Colour vision deficiency
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

---------------------------------------
What is colour vision deficiency (CVD)?
---------------------------------------

Colour vision deficiency (CVD) is also known as colour blindness.
People with CVD are either unable or have a decreased ability to see some colours or distinguish between some colours.
Since very few people are strictly colour *blind*, colour vision deficiency is a better term.
Around 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women in Australia have CVD [#]_.
The cause of colour blindness is usually genetic although some diseases or drugs can also be causes.

---------------
Types of CVD
---------------

There are **different types** of CVD.
Have a look at the following image.

Below shows how people with different types of colour blindness would perceive the same image.

From left to right, the corresponding CVD types are: deuteranopia, protoanopia, tritanopia, and achromatopsia.
We will learn more about each of these and more shortly.

CVD in web design
-----------------

As mentioned previously, it's important to not only use colour to communicate key information.
Otherwise people with CVD miss this information.
An example [#]_ of this is below.
Notice how people with deuteranopia would find it difficult to use the key and only see 4 categories in the chart rather than 6.

.. image:: Images/poor-colour.png

   :width: 15cm
   :align: center

But this doesn't mean that colour must be avoided entirely.
Instead, use other indicators as well as colour such as spacing, borders, patterns, and labels.
Below is an improved version of the same chart.

Adee task 4
-----------

.. admonition:: Adee task 4

     Check the accessibility of a chart for colour vision deficiency.

     1. Select the chart image under Task 4
     2. Open the Adee plugin to "Colorblind Simulator tool"
     3. Check the chart image's colour against the "Tritanopia" colour blind type
     4. Based on this result, do you think the chart's colours should be improved? Please explain your answer
     5. Close the plugin
