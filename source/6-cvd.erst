---------------------------------------
What is colour vision deficiency (CVD)?
---------------------------------------

Colour vision deficiency (CVD) is also known as colour blindness. 
People with CVD are either unable to see some colours or distinguish between some colours. 
Around 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women in Australia have CVD. 
The cause of colour blindness is usually genetic although some diseases or drugs can also be causes.

Types of CVD ‚ùì
---------------

There are **different types** of CVD. 
Have a look at the following image.

Below shows how people with different types of colour blindness would perceive the same image.

From left to right, the corresponding CVD types are: deuteranopia, protoanopia, tritanopia, and achromatopsia. 
We will learn more about each of these and more shortly. 

TODO: Have a look at the different colour blind modes in Adee's colour blindness simulator.

.. fillintheblank:cvd: Not including "Normal", how many types of CVD/colour blindness can you choose from in Adee? |blank|
     correct:8: Correct!
     incorrect:x: Incorrect, have another look.

From this number, there are 4 types of CVD that are *relatively mild*:

:Deuteranomaly:
    Type of **red-green** colour vision deficiency.
    **Most common** form of CVD.
:Protanomaly:
    Another type of **red-green** colour vision deficiency. 
:Tritanomaly:
    Type of **blue-yellow** colour vision deficiency. 
    Less common than the above two red-green CVD types. 
:Achromatomaly:
    Some deficiency in **all colours**. 
    Rarest type of CVD. 

You might notice that the remaining 4 types are related to each of these milder forms. 
The remaining 4 types have the suffix "-opia" or "-opsia" instead of "-omaly" like the milder types. 
These remaining types are complete deficiencies. 
So, people with deuteranopia and protoanopia have complete red-green colour blindness so they cannot tell the difference between those colours at all. 
People with tritanopia have complete blue-yellow colour blindness so they cannot tell the difference between blue and green, purple and red, and yellow and pink. 
People with achromatopsia/monochromacy are unable to see any colour at all. 
This is extremely rare. 

.. mcq:cvd:To test a web design for the most common type of colour blindness, I would test for...
     :Tritanomaly, a type of red-green colour blindness.:Incorrect, tritanomaly is a type of blue-yellow colour blindness and it's not most common.
     correct:Deuteranomaly, a type of red-green colour blindness.:That's right!
     :Tritanomaly, a type of blue-yellow colour blindness.:Incorrect, tritanomaly is a type of blue-yellow colour blindness but it's not most common.
     :Deuteranomaly, a type of blue-yellow colour blindness.:Incorrect, deuteranomaly is most common but it's not a type of blue-yellow colour blindness.

CVD in web design
-----------------

As mentioned previously, it's important to not only use colour to communicate key information. 
Otherwise people with CVD miss key information. 
An example of this is below. 
Notice how people with deuteranopia would find it difficult to use the key and only see 4 categories in the chart rather than 6.

But this doesn't mean that colour must be avoided entirely. 
Instead, use other indicators as well as colour such as spacing, borders, patterns, and labels. 
Below is an improved version of the same chart.
