What is touch target size?
--------------------------

Target size refers to **how large or small buttons or other clickable/touchable targets are** on a website.

Touch target size in the WCAG
---------------------------------

The following is from WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.5.5: Target Size (Level AAA). 
The WCAG can be difficult to understand but we will work through it to understand it and how to apply it. 
Please read the following WCAG excerpt and then answer the following questions. 

    The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels except when...

.. mcq:target-size:Generally, what is the minimum target size from the WCAG?
     :At least 44 mm in height:Incorrect.
     :At least 44 CSS pixels in width:Incorrect.
     :44 by 44 mm:Incorrect.
     correct:44 by 44 CSS pixels.:That's right! üéâ

--------------------------------------
Why does touch target size matter?
--------------------------------------

Here is another excerpt from WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.5.5: Target Size (Level AAA). 
Please read it then answer the following questions. 

    The intent of this success criteria is to ensure that target sizes are large enough for users to easily activate them, even if the user is accessing content on a small handheld touch screen device, has limited dexterity, or has trouble activating small targets for other reasons. 
    For instance, mice and similar pointing devices can be hard to use for these users, and a larger target will help them activate the target.

.. mcq:target-size:From this excerpt, why is it important to have large enough target sizes?
     :Some devices have small screens:That's true but there is a more correct answer.
     :Some users have limited dexterity:That's true but there is a more correct answer.
     :Larger targets help users who find mice hard to use:That's true but there is a more correct answer.
     correct:All of the above:That's right! üéâ

Different target size standards
-------------------------------

As well as the WCAG, there are **other important standards** for touch target size. 
Apple and Android both have guidelines for developers as well as the Nielsen group who provide guidance on user experience. 
However these standards are all slightly different and in different units which makes it difficult to check if all of them are fulfilled. 

:Apple: 44 x 44 pt
:Android: 48 x 48 dp
:Nielsen: 1 x 1 cm
:WCAG: 44 x 44 CSS pixels

Adee simplifies these by converting the standards to the **same unit**, px. 
Adee also helps designers check whether all the standards are fulfilled **all at one glance**.

Above is a screenshot from the Adee interface. 
The upper table shows the size of the selected target in pixels and whether it meets each of the 4 accessibility standards for the device type selected. 
The lower table shows the minimum height and width needed for the button depending on the device type selected (covered below).

Device size

Minimum touch target size **depends on the device** displaying the interface. 
Adee automatically calculates the minimum touch size depending on which device you select. 
It is important to check that a design fulfils the required standards for a range of devices. 

.. Tip:: For elements to be shown in Adee, they must be selected in Figma. Either click or drag-select over elements to select them in Figma.

Adee task 1

.. admonition:: Adee task 1

     Check the target size of a button against accessibility standards. 

     1. Select the button under Task 1
     2. Open the Adee plugin to "Touch Size Checker tool"
     3. Test the size of the button if an iPhone Mini device was used
     4. Based on the results, explain how a designer should improve the button size for better accessibility
     5. Close the plugin
